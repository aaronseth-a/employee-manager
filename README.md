## DESCRIPTION
The goal was to make a management database anyone could use to track their employees. Sometimes it can get complicated to remember when there are too many. This was made in inquirer and the data stored in MySQL so it was a little tricky to master moving data between the two. The formatting was a little difficult as well. It isn't perfect bu it is legible. 

## INSTALLATION
To install load in VS Code, open terminal and enter 'npm run start'.

## USAGE
This program will give the user options to select and prompts to fill out. It is fairly straight forward.

Try inputing things it doesn't ask for or weird symbols to see if it holds up. It could be improved with more input validation.
